JRift
=====

Java Wrapper (JNI) for the Oculus Rift HMD and Sensors under Windows.

You can get a first alpha build (32-bit JRE) from here:
https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8241387/OVR/JRift_alpha.zip

Wanna build it yourself? Compile the Java-part into a JAR (JRift) and compile the C++ part into a .dll (JRiftLibrary). The JRiftLibrary comes with a Visual Studio 2010 project so it should build by only properly setting up the library- and include-reference to the Oculus SDK.
